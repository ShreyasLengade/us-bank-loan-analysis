# Financial Loan Intelligence Dashboard

Welcome to the Financial Loan Intelligence Dashboard repository! Here you will find a collection of Tableau dashboards focusing on various aspects of loans in the banking sector. Each dashboard addresses specific questions and provides insights into different levels of loan data. <b><i>I've also added query document which has all the queries that I used to get data based on KPIs' mentioned. This step was done in MS sql server and it was neccessary to perform so that I could crosscheck the ouput of the Tableau dashboard with the sql queries output. This provided analysis quality and correctness.</i></b>

### Summary Dashboard

<details>
  <summary><strong>Problem Statement</strong></summary>
  This dashboard provides a high-level summary of the total loan portfolio, including the distribution of different KPI's. The explanation why these KPIs' are used is given below:
<ol>
  <li>Total loan applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month- to – Date (MTD) loan applications and track changes Month- over- Month (MoM).</li>
   <li>Total funded amount: - Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD total funded amount and analyze the Month- over- Month (MoM) changes in this metric.</li>
<li>Total amount received: - Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank’s cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyze the Month- to – Date (MTD) total amount received and observe the Month- over- month (MoM) changes.</li>
<li>Average interest rate: - Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio’s overall cost. </li>
<li>Average Debt- to -Income ratio (DTI): - Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.</li>
